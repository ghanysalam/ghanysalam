**Projects**

**Project 1: Travel Insurance Claim Prediction**
Description: Implemented a machine learning model to predict policyholders who are likely to file a travel insurance claim. The primary objective was to assist the insurance company in identifying high-risk policyholders, enabling proactive risk management and personalized customer engagement.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

Key Contributions:

Conducted data exploration to understand the distribution of features and identify potential patterns.
Engineered relevant features, considering factors such as travel destination, trip duration, and past claim history.
Built a predictive model using classification algorithms to identify potential claimants.
Evaluated model performance through metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Project 2: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction**
Description: Developed a predictive model to forecast which bank customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit as part of a marketing campaign. The goal was to optimize the bank's marketing efforts by targeting customers with a higher probability of opening a term deposit account.

Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

Key Contributions:

Explored and preprocessed the bank's marketing data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Conducted feature engineering to capture relevant customer behaviors and characteristics.
Employed classification algorithms to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit.
Utilized model interpretability techniques to understand the factors influencing subscription decisions.
